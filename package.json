  "description": "A Python and JavaScript pipeline that converts Automated Identification System (AIS) data into a {z}/{x}/{y} hierarchy of Mapbox vector tiles in which trajectories are bundled from the bottom {z} level up in order to reduce overlap and clutter in large-scale data, and to ensure continuity between vector tile levels.  Bundling implementation uses the TRACLUS algorithm[1] , the conversion from GEOJSON to Mapbox Vector tile is handled by geojson2mvt[2], and the vector tiles are hosted on a local server using Mapbox vector tile specification and tools[3].",
